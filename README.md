# Lab08-LINQinManhattan

## Challange

* Use a JSON file that contains a data set of location information for properties in Manhattan.
* Use LINQ queries and Lambda statements (when appropriate) to find the answers.
* Output each question and answer to the console:

Questions:

- Output all of the neighborhoods in this data list
- Filter out all the neighborhoods that do not have any names
- Remove the Duplicates
- Rewrite the queries from above, and consolidate all into one single query.
- Rewrite at least one of these questions only using the opposing method (example: Use LINQ instead of a Lambda and vice versa.)

## Solution

Partial sampling of solution.
